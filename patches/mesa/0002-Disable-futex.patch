Subject: [PATCH 3/3] Disable futex for managarm

With the new linux-headers, we now have a <linux/futex.h> present. mesa
seems to guard using the linux syscalls for futex support only behind
the presence of this header, and not by OS - which is incorrect, as the
code assumes Linux due to raw syscalls. Here, we change it to force both
the header to be present and to be linux to use that path, and use the
fallback for managarm (as has been the case previously)
